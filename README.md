Albion and Alex DS340W project on Predicting the next NBA stars

GOAL: Find out the next best players in the NBA (18-23 years old) and can still be in college. Take data from the last 5 years of NBA players and how they might of been in college/combine and predict the next stars of the league.

We are using NBA.com/stats and basketball-reference/stats to find statistics for NBA players in the last 5 years and College basketball players for the last 5 years. We are also using NBA draft combine stats from the NBA website for our data.

We are cleaning these datasets and filter out players who went to college, as well as how they performed at the draft combine and their earlier years in the NBA to try and predict which players can be rising stars in the next few years.
